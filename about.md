Hi, my name is <strong>Andrei Pall</strong> and I am a web applications developer who lives in Brasov, Romania.

I have over 6 years experience with programming languages like Java and PHP and database management systems like MySQL and PostgreSQL.

I am currently employed at <a href="https://www.icore.ro" target="_blank">iCore Outsourcing</a> where I work in many different areas of web development from back end programming (Java, PHP, SQL) to front end engineering (HTML, CSS, and jQuery/JavaScript), user experience and visual design.

I am passionate about software development in all itâ€™s forms and I like helping small businesses and artists build and improve their online presence. Aside from web development, I enjoy spending my time reading books, playing chess and traveling around the world.
