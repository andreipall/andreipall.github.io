Hello, my name is <strong>Andrei Pall</strong> and I am a web applications developer who lives in Brasov, Romania.

I am a man who likes hiking, jogging and walking after work. I am 1.88 m tall and weigh around 95 kilograms.

Lately I have started to study psychology and more precisely emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ). Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict.

Emotional intelligence helps you build stronger relationships, succeed at school and work, and achieve your career and personal goals. It can also help you to connect with your feelings, turn intention into action, and make informed decisions about what matters most to you.

I have over 7 years experience with programming languages like Java and PHP and database management systems like MySQL and PostgreSQL.

I am currently employed at <a href="https://www.icore.ro" target="_blank">iCore Outsourcing</a> where I work in many different areas of web development from back end programming (Java, PHP, SQL) to front end engineering (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery/Backbone), user experience and visual design (<a href="https://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://material.io" target="_blank">Material</a> Design).

I am passionate about software development in all itâ€™s forms and I like helping businesses and artists build and improve their online presence. Aside from web development, I enjoy spending my time reading books, playing chess and traveling around the world.
