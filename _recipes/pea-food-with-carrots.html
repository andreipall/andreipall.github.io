<h3>Pea food with carrots - ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>500 grams of fresh or frozen peas</li>
  <li>1 large or 2 smaller carrots (or baby carrots - if they are)</li>
  <li>2 potatoes</li>
  <li>1 chopped onion</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
  <li>2-3 tablespoons oil</li>
  <li>salt, pepper, chopped dill (I had just dried)</li>
  <li>after taste, a little sugar (if the peas are not sweet enough)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Method of preparation</h3>
<p>The chopped onion and the cleaned and washed carrots and potatoes, cut into thick rounds, are put together with the oil in a saucepan and grilled to the appropriate heat.</p>
<p>Add the peas and fill with hot water, put the lid and let it boil well - it will not last more than five minutes, the peas boil very quickly.</p>
<p>The flour is homogenized with tomato paste, if necessary add water, let it boil, add salt and pepper (possibly sugar, if desired) and sprinkle dill or other greens.</p>
